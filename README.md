# IPL-Data-Analysis
Sample Project
This project focused on the Indian Premier League (IPL) and its players' performance over the past decade. This project involved utilizing Python's powerful libraries, including NumPy and Matplotlib, to analyze and visualize the salaries, games played, and points scored by the top 10 highest-paid players during the 2015-2024 season.

# Key Objectives:
- Analyze trends and patterns in player performance over 10 years.
- Investigate the correlation between player salaries and their performance metrics.
- Visualize data to provide insights into player improvements and career trajectories.
# Data Utilized:
- Players: Top 10 highest-paid players (e.g., Sachin, Rahul, Smith, etc.)

# Metrics Analyzed:
- Total Games Played (GP)
- Minutes Per Game (MPG)
- Field Goal Accuracy
- Points Per Game (PPG)
- Salaries over the years (2015-2024)

# Technical Skills Applied:
- Data Manipulation:
 Used NumPy for efficient matrix operations and managing data storage, enabling fast and effective data handling.
- Data Visualization:
 Applied Matplotlib to generate meaningful visualizations, including graphs and charts, to showcase player performance trends.
- Statistical Analysis:
 Performed in-depth analysis to uncover patterns and correlations within the data, providing insights into player performance.
# Outcomes:
- Developed a clear understanding of how player salaries relate to their performance metrics.
- Created visual representations that highlight significant trends in player performance over the years.
- Gained hands-on experience in data analysis and visualization techniques, enhancing my skills in Python programming.
